# Spatialproteomics Workshop

You can follow this workshop either on `Google Colab`, or run it locally using `conda` and `jupyter lab`.

## Instructions for Colab`
Simply navigate to the notebooks and click on the `Open in Colab` button on top.

## Instructions for conda
To follow this workshop on your local machine, you first need to download the material by cloning the git repository (`git clone https://github.com/MeyerBender/spatialproteomics_workshop.git`). 
Afterwards, you need to set up a virtual environment like this:

- Create the virtual environment: `conda env create -f environments/environment.yml`
- Activate the environment: `conda activate eccb_env`

Once you have activated the virtual environment, you can run `jupyter lab`. Open the notebooks labeled with `task` in the `notebooks` folder, and follow the instructions there. In case you are stuck, you can always refer to the solution, which is provided in the same folder.

## Getting help
